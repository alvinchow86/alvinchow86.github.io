My name is Alvin Chow, I am a software engineer with extensive experience in startups based in the SF Bay Area. I enjoy working across the stack and having a deep understanding of every aspect of a product, from compute infrastructure all the way to client-facing code. I have a strong track record of solving some of the most difficult problems facing engineering orgs.
